Zeavim allows to use the offline documentation browser Zeal(http://zealdocs.org) from Vim.

# Features:
    * Search word under cursor or a visual selection.
    * Search without losing focus from Vim if Zeal is already opened (Need wmctrl on UNIX).
    * Possibility to specify dynamically a docset.
    * Narrow search with a query.
    * Allows using multiple docsets.
    * Docset name completion.
    * Define you own docsets using file types, extentions or regex.
    * Supports docsets specific to file names (e.g gulpfile.js)
    * Works on GNU/Linux and Windows.

Don't forget to rate it if you find it useful ( Or useless ;) ).
